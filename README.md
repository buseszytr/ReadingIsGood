# Design :

This app has three layers that are Domain, Infrastructure, and API.

The Application Layer presents the restful endpoints 
The domain layer is the deep layer where the code-behind logic is run. The domain layer is the layer where the data returning to the interface is parsed from the database models. There is no business logic in this layer.
The Infrastructure layer includes data access implementations, service business logic. In a Mongo DbContext and data access implementation classes.
